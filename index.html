		<h1>I know why the caged bird sings</h1>
		<h3>Maya Angelou</h3>
		<p>
		A free <strong> bird </strong> leaps on the back Of the wind and floats downstream Till <br> the current ends and dips his wing In the orange suns rays And dares <br> to claim the sky. But a <strong> bird </strong> that stalks down his narrow <em>cage</em> Can s<br>eldom see through his bars of rage His wings are clipped and his feet <br>are tied So he opens his throat to sing. The <em>cage</em>d <strong> bird </strong> sings with a fe<br>arful trill Of things unknown but longed for still And his tune is hear<br>d on the distant hill for The <em>cage</em>d <strong> bird </strong> sings of freedom. The free <strong> bir </strong><br><strong> d </strong> thinks of another breeze And the trade winds soft through The sigh<br>ing trees And the fat worms waiting on a dawn-bright Lawn and he n<br>ames the sky his own. But a <em>cage</em>d <strong> bird </strong> stands on the grave of drea<br>ms His shadow shouts on a nightmare scream His wings are clipped <br>eand his fet are tied So he opens his throat to sing. The <em>cage</em>d <strong> bird </strong> si<br>ngs with A fearful trill of things unknown But longed for still and hi<br>s Tune is heard on the distant hill For the <em>cage</em>d <strong> bird </strong> sings of f&nbsp;r&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;m&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
